# Malware Detection Tool

## Overview
The Malware Detection Tool is a sandbox environment designed for analyzing and detecting malware behavior. This project aims to provide a safe space to execute potentially harmful software while monitoring its behavior, including process activity, file changes, and network activity. The tool is developed using Python and Docker, ensuring an isolated and controlled execution environment.

## Features
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks active processes, capturing their PID, name, and CPU usage.
- **File Monitoring**: Monitors file creation events in the sandbox environment.
- **Network Monitoring**: Captures network packets to analyze outgoing and incoming traffic.
- **Docker Integration**: Provides a controlled environment for executing malware.
- **Log Collection**: Gathers logs from monitoring scripts for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for the monitoring scripts.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for creating the sandbox environment.
- **psutil**: Library for process and system monitoring.
- **pyinotify**: Library for monitoring file system events.
- **pyshark**: Library for capturing network packets.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the Malware Detection Tool:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
- Go to GitHub and sign in.
- Click on the **New** button to create a repository.
- Name your repository `malware-detection-tool`.
- Add a description: "A sandbox environment for analyzing and detecting malware behavior."
- Initialize the repository with a `README.md` file and add a `.gitignore` file (select the Python template).
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/malware-detection-tool.git
    cd malware-detection-tool
    ```

### 2. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
- Create the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```
- Install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install psutil pyshark pyinotify
    ```
- Freeze the dependencies into a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
- Update your GitHub repository with the new files:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Setup Python virtual environment and installed dependencies"
    git push origin main
    ```

### 3. Set Up Docker Sandbox
- Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project:
    ```bash
    touch Dockerfile
    ```
- Edit the `Dockerfile` with the following content:
    ```dockerfile
    # Base image: Ubuntu
    FROM ubuntu:20.04

    # Update packages and install dependencies
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip tcpdump

    # Install Python libraries
    RUN pip3 install psutil pyshark pyinotify

    # Set working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /sandbox

    # Copy local project files into the container
    COPY . /sandbox
    ```
- Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t malware-sandbox .
    ```
- Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -it malware-sandbox
    ```

## Usage
### Running the Monitoring Scripts
- **Process Monitoring**: Execute `process_monitor.py` to track active processes.
    ```bash
    python process_monitor.py
    ```

- **File Monitoring**: Execute `file_monitor.py` to monitor file creation events.
    ```bash
    python file_monitor.py
    ```

- **Network Monitoring**: Execute `network_monitor.py` to capture network packets.
    ```bash
    python network_monitor.py
    ```

### Executing Malware
- Create a script `malware_exec.py` to run malware samples within the sandbox:
    ```python
    import subprocess

    def execute_malware():
        try:
            subprocess.run(["/path/to/malware"], check=True)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print(f"Error executing malware: {e}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        execute_malware()
    ```
- Place a malware sample in the `/sandbox` directory in Docker and execute the script:
    ```bash
    python malware_exec.py
    ```

## Monitoring Scripts
The project includes the following monitoring scripts:
- `process_monitor.py`: Monitors active processes in the sandbox.
- `file_monitor.py`: Monitors file creation events in the sandbox directory.
- `network_monitor.py`: Captures and analyzes network packets.

## Collecting Logs
- Redirect the output of the monitoring scripts to log files.
- Aggregate logs for analysis.

## Contributing
